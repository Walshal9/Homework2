## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
## Scenerio 1.

#a) 
#Null Hypotheses:The amount of shrimp caught will have no change between 2009-2010
#ALternate Hypotheses: The amount of shrimp caught is significantly diffrent from 2009-2010

```{r}
#b)
Shrimp=read.csv(file.choose())
Shrimp

```
```{r}
hist(Shrimp$X2009.catch..tonnes.)
hist(Shrimp$X2010.catch..tonnes.)
```
#C)
#For this scenerio we would want to use a paired two-samle t-test that would compare the mean between both years of shrimp yields.

```{r}
#d)
post=(Shrimp$X2010.catch..tonnes.)
pre=(Shrimp$X2009.catch..tonnes.)
t.test(post, pre, paired=TRUE)

qt(0.95,(14-1))
```

#e)
# The critical value is +-1.770933, our observed value is is -6.3808
#f)
# The observed value is in the critical region, additionally the pvalue<0.05, we would therfore reject the null hypothesis and there is a significant change between shrimp harvest from 2009 to 2010.

## Scenerio 2.

#a) 
#Null Hypotheses:The total phosphorous level is 15ug/L or less
#ALternate Hypotheses: The amount  of phosphorous is more than 15ug/L

```{r}
#b)
Total_Phosphorous=c(18.4, 12.9, 15.3, 18.3, 15.6, 23.3, 16.5, 12.3, 24.6, 16.2)
hist(Total_Phosphorous)

```
#C)
#For this scenerio we would want to use a one-sample t-test that would compare the mean between the water sample of phosphorous.

```{r}
#d)

t.test(Total_Phosphorous, mu=15)

qt(0.95,(10-1))
```

#e)
# The critical value is +1.833113, our observed value is is 1.8462
#f)
# The observed value is in the critical region, we would therfore reject the null hypothesis and the level of phosphorous is over the maximum guidline of 15ug/l.


## Scenerio 3.

#a) 
#Null Hypotheses:There is no diffrence in growth rate of fish.
#ALternate Hypotheses: There is a diffrence in the growth rate of fish.

```{r}
#b)
Fish=read.csv(file.choose())
Fish

```
```{r}
hist(Fish$Carnivorous)
hist(Fish$Vegetarian)
```
#C)
#For this scenerio we would want to use a one-sample t-test that would compare the mean between both years of shrimp yields.

```{r}
#d)
post=(Fish$Carnivorous)
pre=(Fish$Vegetarian)
t.test(post, pre, paired=TRUE)

qt(0.95,(15-1))
```

#e)
# The critical value is +-1.76131, our observed value is is 15.162
#f)
# The observed value is in the critical region, additionally the pvalue<0.05, we would therfore reject the null hypothesis and the vegeterian diet differs from the carnivorous diet in terms of growth rate.

## Scenerio 4.

#a) 
#Null Hypotheses: PCB poisoning is equall between trophic levels.
#ALternate Hypotheses: PCB poisoning is not equall between trophic levels.

```{r}
#b)
#Histogram is not relevant for this part, but I did it anyways as per the question.
PCB=read.csv(file.choose())
PCB

```
```{r}
hist(PCB$No.effect)
hist(PCB$No.reproduction)
hist(PCB$Death)

```
#C)
#For this scenerio we would want to use a chi-squared that would compare independance between categorical variables.

```{r}
#d)
FirstTrophicLevel=c(133,	100,	17)
TopPredator=c(4, 61, 35)
pcb=data.frame('F'=FirstTrophicLevel, 'T'=TopPredator)

chisq.test(pcb)

qchisq(0.95,2)

```

#e)
# The critical value is +-5.991465, our observed value is is 89.253
#f)
# The observed value is in the critical region, additionally the pvalue<0.05, we would therfore reject the null hypothesis and the pcb levels are unequal between the 1st trophic level and top predators.
